              Cantonese Yale: dímsām) is a large range of small dishes that Cantonese people traditionally enjoy in
              restaurants for breakfast and lunch. In the tenth century, when the city of Guangzhou (Canton) began to
              experience an increase in commercial travel, travelers concurrently began to frequent teahouses for
              small-portion meals with tea called yum cha, or "drink tea" meals.[4][3][5] Yum cha includes two related
              concepts.The first is 盅兩件, which translates literally as "one cup, two pieces". This refers to the custom
              of serving teahouse customers two pieces of delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement
              their tea. The second is 點心, which means dim sum and translates literally to "touching heart" (i.e. heart
              touching), the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea drinking.(wikipedia)
